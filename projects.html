					<h2>Industry 4.0 Drone</h2>
					<h3>C++, OpenCV, ODROID XU4, PixHawk Flight Controller</h3>
					<p>Currently developing an autonomous drone for indoor use in a factory setting. Presently, I am preparing the drone for initial flight tests, having already configured to power distrinution and control systems. In the future state, the drone will act as a delivery method at the end of a miniature assembly line as part of UW Management Engineering's Industry 4.0 lab. The lab is used for case studies in management engineering classes. The telemetry systems will eventually include a computer vision system using OpenCV (already partially developed, running on an ODROID) as wel as one or two ultrasonic sensors. The PixHawk controller will handle the autopilot code once it is written.</p>

					<h2><a href="https://github.com/haydengunraj/MotionTracker">MotionTracker</a></h2>
					<h3>Python, OpenCV, MatPlotLib, Git</h3>
					<p>I developed a toolset for the tracking and kinematics analysis of objects in videos. The tracker allows for a user to define a coordinate system and scale via a graphical interface with drag-and-drop commands, and subsequently position, velocity, and acceleration can be computed and displayed graphically in true spatial coordinates. OpenCV handles the processing of images, while MatPlotLib is used to visualize the computed kinematics data.</p>

					<h2><a href="https://github.com/haydengunraj/LogicSim">LogicSim</a></h2>
					<h3>Python, Tkinter</h3>
					<p>Stemming from my coursework in data structures, algorithms, and digital logic, I created a basic logic circuit simulator. The backend of the simulator uses a graph-like structure to keep track of logic gates and their connections. The circuit is simulated by starting from the outputs and recursing backwards to the inputs. On the user-facing side, the Tkinter library was used to create a graphical interface, including drag-and-drop placement of logic gates and wires. Output is provided in the form of a truth table for the circuit.</p>

					<h3>C, EV3 Robot</h3>
					<p>For my MTE 100 final project, I worked with three classmates to design and program a golf tee resetting robot. The robot quickly and accurately places golf balls on a fixed tee for use at driving ranges. I was primarily responsible for the software component of the project, working to implement key functions and control flow for the main program. I was also responsible for predicting possible errors and adding error checks into the software, along with a running log of errors which had occurred.</p>

					<h3>Python, Mechanize, Git</h3>
					<p>For this project, I developed a Python library for York Region District School Board students to interact with their grade information from the YRDSB TeachAssist and CareerCruising sites. This was achieved using automated login and scraping using the Mechanize library. Upon retrieval, the grade information could also be output to an Excel file using the XlsxWriter library.</p>
